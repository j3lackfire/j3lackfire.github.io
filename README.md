# TIES532 front end

The front-end for the TIES532's server. Literally a single html file.

The file is uploaded to page.github.io so this git project is also the front-end host.

Fill all of the 4 neccessary information into the box, and then click on the Init server. 

Afterwards, if the initiation is completed, the backup button will appear and you can click it and start backing up your files from Dropbox to Sendspace

You can also locally download this file and change the host in the <script> tag at the bottom so that it sends request to local.
